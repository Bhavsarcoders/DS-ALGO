"""
You are given two positive integers a and b.

In one move, you can change a in the following way:

Choose any positive odd integer x (x>0) and replace a with a+x;
choose any positive even integer y (y>0) and replace a with aâˆ’y.
You can perform as many such operations as you want. You can choose the same numbers x and y in different moves.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain b from a. It is guaranteed that you can always obtain b from a.

You have to answer t independent test cases.
